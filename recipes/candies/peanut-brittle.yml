title: Peanut Brittle

sections:
- Ingredients:
  - 2 cups white sugar
  - 1 cup corn syrup
  - 1 cup water
  - 3 cups peanuts
  - 2 tablespoons butter
  - 2 teaspoons vanilla
  - 2 teaspoons baking soda

- Directions:
  - Mix sugar, syrup and water in sauce pan. Cover and heat to boiling.
  - Uncover and heat to 230 degrees F. (soft ball stage).
  - Stir in nuts slowly - keep boiling - cook rapidly to hard ball stage (250 degrees F.). Sir in butter.
  - Cook to hard crack stage (300 degrees F.).
  - Remove from heat and stir in vanilla - be careful - it will splatter.
  - Sprinkle baking soda over the top and stir for 15 seconds until mixture is fluffy.
  - Spread out on very large buttered baking sheet. Use oven mitts and parchment paper on top to help it spread - it also helps if the pan is warmed a little so the candy does not cool too fast before it can spread thin.
  - Break into small pieces when cold.
