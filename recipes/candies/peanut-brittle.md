# Ingredients

* 2 cups white sugar
* 1 cup corn syrup
* 1 cup water
* 3 cups peanuts
* 2 tablespoons butter
* 2 teaspoons vanilla
* 2 teaspoons baking soda

# Directions

1. Mix sugar, syrup and water in sauce pan. Cover and heat to boiling.
1. Uncover and heat to 230 degrees F. (soft ball stage).
1. Stir in nuts slowly - keep boiling - cook rapidly to hard ball stage (250 degrees F.). Sir in butter.
1. Cook to hard crack stage (300 degrees F.).
1. Remove from heat and stir in vanilla - be careful - it will splatter.
1. Sprinkle baking soda over the top and stir for 15 seconds until mixture is fluffy.
1. Spread out on very large buttered baking sheet. Use oven mitts and parchment paper on top to help it spread - it also helps if the pan is warmed a little so the candy does not cool too fast before it can spread thin.
1. Break into small pieces when cold.
