- Description:
  - This is a three layer bar, with a whipped shortbread cookie base, then a layer of homemade caramel, and topped with a layer of Kahlua chocolate ganache
- "Cookie Base Ingredients":
  - 1 1/2 C butter
  - 1 tsp vanilla extract
  - 75 g confectioners suga
  - 280 g flour
  - 90 g cornstarch
- "Caramel Ingredients":
  - 1 1/2 C white sugar
  - 1/2 C butter (1 stick)
  - 1/2 C whipping cream
- "Ganache Ingredients":
  - 1 C chocolate chips
  - 1/4 C whipping cream
  - 1/4 Kahlua  

- "Cookie Base Directions":
  - beat the butter, vanilla, and confectioners sugar in a medium bowl for 4 or 5 minutes
  - in a separate bowl, sift together the flour and cornstarch
  - slowly add dry ingredients to whipped ingredients until mixture holds shape but is still crumbly.  Do not overmix or add too much dry ingredients so it gets too crumbly and won't hold together
  - line a 7 or 8 inch pan with parchment paper
  - lightly spray the parchment paper with non-stick spray
  - spread the dough into the pan and lightly compress with the bottom of a glass or a ramekin
  - chill in the fridge for a couple hours, or the freezer for 30 minutes
  - bake at 370 for 20 mins
  - remove to a cooling rack and let cool in the pan

- "Caramel Directions"
  - this caramel recipe is taken from [here](https://youtu.be/ULwzI2_ZG2Y?t=134)
  - add sugar to high-sided pot and turn burner on to medium
  - stir as sugar begins to melt.  Keep a close eye on it at all times
  - once it's melted, let darken until desired depth of flavour.  It becomes more bitter as it darkens
  - turn the heat down a little, add the butter, and stir.  It will likely foam a little.
  - stir in the cream and whisk until well blended
  - remove from heat and strain into a large heat resistent measuring cup or other container
  - pour over the cookie base and place pan in freezer for 30 minutes

- "Ganache Directions"
  - add all ingredients to a microwave safe bowl or mixing cup (like a 2 C pyrex)
  - microwave for 1 minute and then stir
  - continue microwaving for 30 seconds at a time and stirring until fully mixed
  - allow to cool as much as possible but still liquidy.  Too hot and it will melt the caramel when we add it, too cool and it will be difficult to spread
  - when ready, remove pan from freezer and spread ganache evenly on top
  - chill pan in fridge for 1 to 2 hours
