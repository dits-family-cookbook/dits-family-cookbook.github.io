- Description:
  - This is a three layer bar, with a whipped shortbread cookie base, then a layer of homemade caramel, and topped with a layer of chocolate ganache
- "Cookie Base Ingredients":
  - 3/4 C butter (160 g) at room temperature
  - 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 40 g confectioners sugar
  - 195 g flour
  - 65 g cornstarch
- "Caramel Ingredients":
  - 1 1/2 C white sugar
  - 1/2 C butter (1 stick)
  - 1/2 C heavy cream
- "Ganache Ingredients":
  - 1 C chocolate chips
  - 1/2 C heavy cream

- "Cookie Base Directions":
  - beat the butter, vanilla, and confectioners sugar in a small bowl with a hand mixer for 3 minutes
  - in a separate bowl, sift together the flour and cornstarch
  - slowly add dry ingredients to whipped ingredients until mixture holds shape and is slightly crumbly.  Discard remaining flour mixture.  Do not overmix or add too much dry ingredients so it gets too crumbly and won't hold together
  - line a 7 or 8 inch pan with parchment paper, preferably something where the bottom is removable
  - add the dough to the pan by breaking into small chunks and evenly distributing
  - lightly pat down to combine into a uniform base.  Try to maintain as much height as possible
  - chill in the fridge for an hour or two
  - bake at 350 for 20 mins, then broil with the door partially open until the top is lightly browned.  It will brown quickly, so keep a close eye on it.
  - remove to a cooling rack and let cool while making the caramel

- "Caramel Directions":
  - this caramel recipe is taken from [here](https://youtu.be/ULwzI2_ZG2Y?t=134)
  - as tempting as it may be, do not stick your finger into the caramel at any time in order to taste it!
  - have all ingredients ready, you won't have time to measure once the sugar is melted
  - add sugar to high-sided pot and turn burner on to medium
  - stir as sugar begins to melt.  Keep a close eye on it at all times
  - once it's melted, let darken until desired depth of flavour.  It becomes more bitter as it darkens
  - turn the heat down a little, add the butter, and stir.  It will likely foam a little.
  - stir in the cream and whisk until well blended
  - remove from heat and strain into a large heat resistant measuring cup or other container
  - lightly wipe any exposed pan surfaces with a paper towel that's been sprayed with non-stick spray
  - pour over the cookie base, let cool for 30 minutes, then place (level) in freezer for 30 minute before starting the ganache
  - to clean up the pot later, just boil some water in it

- "Ganache Directions":
  - start the ganache after the pan with the caramel has been in the freezer about 30 minutes
  - add all ganache ingredients to a microwave safe bowl or mixing cup (like a 2 C pyrex)
  - microwave for 30 seconds at a time and stir until fully melted
  - allow to cool for about 30 minutes
  - remove pan from freezer
  - lightly wipe any exposed pan surfaces with a paper towel that's been sprayed with non-stick spray
  - pour ganache evenly on top
  - chill pan in fridge for at least 1 to 2 hours
  - refrigerate until ready to serve to prevent layers from becoming too soft when left out
