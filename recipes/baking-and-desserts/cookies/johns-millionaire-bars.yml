- Description:
  - This is a three layer bar, with a whipped shortbread cookie base, then a layer of homemade caramel, and topped with a layer of Kahlua chocolate ganache
- "Cookie Base Ingredients":
  - 3/4 C butter (160 g)
  - 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
  - 40 g confectioners sugar
  - 195 g flour
  - 65 g cornstarch
- "Caramel Ingredients":
  - 1 1/2 C white sugar
  - 1/2 C butter (1 stick)
  - 1/2 C whipping cream
- "Ganache Ingredients":
  - 1 C chocolate chips
  - 1/3 C whipping cream
  - 3 Tbsp Kahlua  

- "Cookie Base Directions":
  - beat the butter, vanilla, and confectioners sugar in a medium bowl for 4 or 5 minutes
  - in a separate bowl, sift together the flour and cornstarch
  - slowly add dry ingredients to whipped ingredients until mixture holds shape and is slightly crumbly.  Discard remaining flour mixture.  Do not overmix or add too much dry ingredients so it gets too crumbly and won't hold together
  - line a 7 or 8 inch pan with parchment paper, preferably something where the bottom is removable
  - add the dough to the pan by breaking into small chunks and evenly distributing
  - lightly pat down to combine into a uniform base.  Try to maintain as much height as possible
  - chill in the fridge for an hour or two
  - bake at 350 for 20 to 25 mins, then place on the bottom rack under the broiler with the door partially open until the top is lightly browned.  It will brown quickly, so keep a close eye on it.
  - remove to a cooling rack and let cool while making the caramel

- "Caramel Directions":
  - this caramel recipe is taken from [here](https://youtu.be/ULwzI2_ZG2Y?t=134)
  - as tempting as it may be, do not stick your finger into the caramel at any time in order to taste it!
  - add sugar to high-sided pot and turn burner on to medium
  - stir as sugar begins to melt.  Keep a close eye on it at all times
  - once it's melted, let darken until desired depth of flavour.  It becomes more bitter as it darkens
  - turn the heat down a little, add the butter, and stir.  It will likely foam a little.
  - stir in the cream and whisk until well blended
  - remove from heat and strain into a large heat resistant measuring cup or other container
  - pour over the cookie base, let cool for 30 minutes, then place in freezer for 1 hour

- "Ganache Directions":
  - only start the ganache after the pan with the caramel has been sitting in the freezer for an hour
  - add all ganache ingredients to a microwave safe bowl or mixing cup (like a 2 C pyrex)
  - microwave for 1 minute and then stir
  - continue microwaving for 30 seconds at a time and stirring until fully mixed
  - allow to cool as much as possible while still remaining liquidy.  Too hot and it will melt the caramel when we add it, too cool and it will be difficult to spread
  - when ready, remove pan from freezer and pour ganache evenly on top
  - chill pan in fridge for at least 1 to 2 hours
  - refrigerate until ready to serve to prevent layers from becoming too soft when left out
