- Ingredients:

### Yudane

- 200 g milk (cow or soy)
- 200 g bread flour

### Dough

- 200 g milk (cow or soy)
- 600 g bread flour
- 1/2 C sugar
- 1 pkg instant yeast (8 grams)
- 1 tsp salt
- 1/3 C margarine (or softened/melted butter)
- 2 eggs (or 1/3 C "Just Egg" substitute)


### Filling

- 1/4 C margarine/butter
- 1 C brown sugar
- 2 1/2 Tbsp ground cinnamon

### Frosting


- 1 1/2 C icing sugar
- 1/4 C margarine/butter
- 3 ounces cream cheese, softened
- 1/2 tsp vanilla extract
- 1/8 tsp salt


- Directions:

### Yudane

- prepare the yudane the night before
- add the 200 g flour to a medium sized bowl
- gently bring milk to a simmer in a small pot.  Use enough milk to be sure there will be 200 g to add to the flour.  Consider using about twice the amount, then make a nice milk and honey drink with whatever is left :-)
- once simmering, immediately measure the 200 g and then add it to the flour.  Stir quickly, just enough until no dry flour remains
- immediately cover in plastic wrap
- let cool, then refrigerate overnight.

### Next Day

- the following day, remove all cold ingredients (yudane, yeast, margarine, eggs) from the fridge 2 to 3 hrs before starting the dough recipe.  Place the yudane in the oven with the light on (still covered).
- 2 to 3 hrs later, begin making the dough
- gently bring the milk to about 55 or 60 C in a small pot.  Again, be sure there will be 200 g available once heating and measuring is complete
- measure the 200 g milk in to a large bowl, then monitor temperature until at approx 50 C
- add the sugar and yeast, stir, and let sit for 5 minutes
- add the eggs, margarine/butter, and salt
- tear the yudane into walnut sized pieces and mix in
- add the 600 g flour about a cup at a time until a nice dough forms in the bowl
- transfer to a lightly floured surface
- knead until the dough passes the "window pane" test
- cover with plastic wrap and place in the oven (light on) for 1 hour
- after 1 hr, remove dough from oven and punch it down
- roll out to a rectangle approximately 14 x 22 inches.  Tip - to get a nice rectangle shape, roll to a rough rectangle, then fold in thirds so the long end shifts 90 degrees, then roll out in this new orientation
- lightly butter, leaving 1 inch unbuttered on one side 
- mix the brown sugar and cinnamon in a bowl, then sprinkle over the butter
- roll the dough (from the opposite end of the 1 inch unbuttered side) into a log (so it ends up as long as the longest side of the rectangle).  Don't roll too tight, or the centers will pop out while baking.
- use a ruler or tape measure and make marks every 2 inches along the roll (not as big of a pain as it sounds)
- using dental floss, slide the floss under the roll, then cross on top and pull tight to cut the roll into individual buns
- place the buns on a parchment paper covered baking sheet.
- pinch the "tails" a bit to keep the rolls from unravelling.  Buns can also be place with the tails butted together.
- cover with plastic wrap (or whatever your preferred rising covering is) and place in the oven (with light on) for another hour
- remove buns from oven
- pre-heat oven to 375 F with tray on lower 1/3 rack position
- bake for about 18 minutes
- remove from oven, let stand 15 minutes
- while cooling, mix icing ingredients together
- once cooled, top with icing.
