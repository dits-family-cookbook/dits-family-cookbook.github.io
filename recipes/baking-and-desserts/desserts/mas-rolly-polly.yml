- Ingredients:

  - 2 1/2 cups sifted pastry flour
  - 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
  - 1 teaspoon salt
  - 1/4 cup white sugar
  - 2/3 cup butter
  - 1 egg
  - 2/3 cup milk
  - 1/2 to 3/4 cup plum jam

- Directions:

  - Combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
  - Cut butter into dry ingredients.
  - Beat egg with milk and combine with dry ingredients, mixing lightly with a fork.
  - Pat out on a board into an oblong about 1/2 inch thick.
  - Spread with jam and roll up like a jelly roll, tucking in ends so they do not
    leak.
  - Make a few slits in the top and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
  - Bake at 375 degrees F. for 40 minutes.

- Tips:
  - It helps if you pat it out on parchment paper to lift it into the pan - just leave
    it on the paper to cook.
