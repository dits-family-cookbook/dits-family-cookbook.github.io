# Ingredients

* 2 1/2 cups sifted pastry flour
* 3 1/2 teaspoons baking powder
* 1 teaspoon salt
* 1/4 cup white sugar
* 2/3 cup butter
* 1 egg
* 2/3 cup milk
* 1/2 to 3/4 cup plum jam

# Directions

1. Combine flour, baking powder, salt and sugar.
1. Cut butter into dry ingredients.
1. Beat egg with milk and combine with dry ingredients, mixing lightly with a fork.
1. Pat out on a board into an oblong about 1/2 inch thick.
1. Spread with jam and roll up like a jelly roll, tucking in ends so they do not leak.
1. Make a few slits in the top and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon.
1. Bake at 375 degrees F. for 40 minutes.

It helps if you pat it out on parchment paper to lift it into the pan - just leave it on the paper to cook.
