- Ingredients:
  - 3 eggs
  - 1 cup milk
  - 1 cup all purpose flour
  - pinch of salt

- Directions:
  - Start early in the day - around lunch time if you want the Yorkshire puddings
    for supper (can also start the batter the night before and refrigerate overnight)
  - Beat the 3 eggs together.
  - Add the milk and beat again.
  - Add the flour and salt and beat again.  Add an additional Tbsp or two of flour
    if mixture looks too thin.  Should be about the consistency of crepe batter.
  - Leave unrefrigerated.  Every hour or so, until ready to cook, give them a good
    beating - a hand beater or electric beater works fine.
  - Heat the muffin pans with a small amount of fat in them in a 450 degree F. oven.
    for approx 5 to 10 minutes.
  - Beat one last time, then fill the pan wells 2/3 full with batter.
  - If any wells remain unfilled (only oil), fill with some bread to prevent smoking
  - Bake at 450 degrees F. for 15 minutes then reduce heat to 350 degrees F. and bake
    for 10 to 15 minutes longer.
