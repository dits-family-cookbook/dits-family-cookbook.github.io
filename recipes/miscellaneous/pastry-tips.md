- Good Pastry:
  - Good pasty is flaky, tender, delicate, and evenly browned.
  - It is not crumbly, but when broken, shows layers of flat flakes, piled one above the other with air spaces between.
  - To achieve this result, the cook must be quick and "light-handed", since the pastry cannot be good if handled roughly or slowly.
  - The flakiness of pastry is caused by many particles of fat which are surrounded and separated by flour.
  - During baking, each fat particle melts to form a delicate flake. 
  - However, rough, slow handling may cause these particles to melt and blend with the flour to form a solid mass, which is tough and hard after baking.
- Everything Must Be Cold:
  - Chilled ingredients are important for success and for the beginner even the flour may be chilled.
  - A cold, solid fat and ice water are essentials.
  - Baking powder is sometimes used but with skillful mixing and handling of the dough it is unnecessary.
  - Sift flour and salt together, then add cold fat and cut in as quickly as possible.
  - A pastry blender is one of the best utensils to use for this purpose, although a quick job can be done with 2 knives.
  - The fingers may be used by those able to work rapidly enough to work in the fat before it starts to melt from the heat of the fingers.
  - Distribute the fat evenly through the flour, being sure not to neglect that at the bottom of the bowl.
  - It has been mixed sufficiently when the largest pieces of fat are the size of small peas.
  - These particles roll out and melt into crisp flakes.
  - The mixture may be placed in a clean jar, covered, and kept in the refrigerator.
- How Much Water:
  - The greatest care is required when adding water.
  - No definite amount can be specified since this varies with the dryness of the flour and the amount of shortening used.
  - Usually 2 to 4 tablespoons water are required for 1 cup flour.
  - Sprinkle the water a tablespoon at a time over the flour mixture while tossing it quickly with a fork.
  - Avoid stirring or mixing that would crush fat particles and blend them with the flour.
  - Push moistened portions to one side before adding more water so a dry portion can be sprinkled each time.
  - If allowed to do so, the fat-flour mixture will absorb a great deal more water than should be used, so care must be taken to keep the moisture well distributed.
  - Too much moisture makes the crust hard and brittle.
  - Too little makes a crust which cracks at the edges while being rolled; it may crack open while baking and the finished pie be difficult to serve
- Be Swift and Deft:
  - When moist enough to hold together under slight pressure, divide into halves, press each into a ball, flatten our with hands, and chill.
  - If too little or too much water has been used, nothing can be done about it, except to profit by experience next time.
  - Sprinkle board and rolling pin lightly with flour and rub into wood.
  - A canvas cloth or coarse linen kitchen towel to cover the board and a "stocking" for the rolling pin are aids to the rolling out process, by preventing sticking without the use of too much flour.
  - Excess flour on board and pin make the crust hard.
  - Roll quickly but lightly since heavy pressure makes the pastry stick and breaks the surface.
  - Start each stroke at the center of dough and roll to edge, keeping pastry in as circular a shape as possible and keeping edges as thick as center.
  - Lift and turn pastry occasionally to make sure it is not sticking and rub extra flour over board if necessary.
  - Keep all particles of dough cleaned from uncovered rolling pin since the pastry being rolled will stick to these more readily than to the wood.
  - Roll out to 1/8 inch thickness for lower crust; roll top crust slightly thinner.
  - Place pastry in pans and bake as directed (note - can be re-chilled for 30 mins before baking)
