title: John's Pan Seasoning

sections:
- Ingredients:
  - vegetable shortening
  - about 6 pieces of paper-towel

- Directions:
  - these directions are for pre-seasoning a stainless-steel pan, such as an All-Clad
  - first thoroughly wash the pan with soap and a mild abrasive such as Barkeepers Friend or baking soda
  - dry completely with paper-towel
  - place the pan on the stove
  - turn on the fan on the range-hood
  - set the element to medium-high and set a timer for **7** minutes.  The heat will remain on for a total of **7** minutes
  - during the first **2** minutes, simply allow the pan to warm and evaporate all remaining moisture
  - at the **2** minute mark (5 minutes remaining on the timer) drop about an almond-nut sized amount of shortening into the pan and immediately coat the entire interior surface of the pan using 2 **new** and **clean** pieces of paper-towel
  - discard the first pieces of paper towel and use another couple pieces of paper towel to keep wiping away the shortening from the pan
  - discard the seconds pieces of paper towel and use the final **new** couple pieces of paper towel to completely remove any remaining shorting
  - the pan should basically look dry/matt again at the point
  - wait for the timer to go off and turn off the heat, but leave the pan on the element
  - let cool
  - when ready to cook, simply follow the normal cooking instructions.  Ie - if the recipe calls for oil/butter to be added to the pan, then you must still do that
  - so, to recap - the heat is on for a total of **7** minutes.  During the first **2** minutes, the pan is simply warming up.  After that, quickly apply the shortening and then wipe away until the pan looks dry again.  Let sit for the remaining time and then just turn off the heat, leaving the pan on the element to cool
