# Ingredients

* 3 eggs
* 1 cup milk
* 1 cup all purpose flour
* pinch of salt

# Directions

1. Start early in the day - around lunch time if you want the Yorkshire puddings for supper
1. Beat the 3 eggs together.
1. Add the milk and beat again.
1. Add the flour and salt and beat again.  Add an additional Tbsp or two of flour if mixture looks too thin.  Should be about the consistency of crepe batter.
1. Leave unrefrigerated.  Every hour or so, until ready to cook, give them a good beating - a hand beater or electric beater works fine.
1. Heat the muffin pans with a small amount of fat in them in a 450 degree F. oven. for approx 5 to 10 minutes.
1. Beat one last time, then fill the pan wells 2/3 full with batter.
1. If any wells remain unfilled (only oil), fill with some bread to prevent smoking
1. Bake at 450 degrees F. for 15 minutes then reduce heat to 350 degrees F. and bake for 10 to 15 minutes longer.
