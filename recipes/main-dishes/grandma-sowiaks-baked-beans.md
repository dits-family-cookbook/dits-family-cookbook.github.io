From an old Ukrainian recipe book that belonged to Grandma Sowiak.

# Ingredients

1. 1 1/2 cups dried white beans
1. 3 cups cold water
1. 2 1/2 teaspoons soya sauce
1. 4 slices bacon chopped
1. 1/4 cup chopped onion
1. 1 can (14 ounces) pineapple tidbits and juice
1. 1/4 teaspoon garlic salt
1. 1 can (10 ounces) tomato soup
1. 1 tablespoon soya sauce
1. 2 tablespoons molasses
1. 2 tablespoons brown sugar

# Directions

1. Wash beans, any that float are no good so scoop them off and rinse again.
1. Pour the 3 cups cold water and the 2 1/2 teaspoons soya sauce over the beans and soak overnight.
1. Next morning there should be about 1 cup liquid left.
1. Boil the beans in this liquid for 45 minutes, add more water if necessary.
1. Add the bacon (uncooked or lightly pan fried), onions, pineapple and juice, garlic salt, tomato soup, soya sauce, molasses and brown sugar.
1. Bake about 3 hours at 325 degrees F. in a bean pot or clay baker, stirring once or twice during cooking.


# Alternate No-Soak Instant Pot Directions

1.  This method requires the instant pot glass lid.
1.  Combine dry beans with 3 cups water in instant pot.
1.  Add the 2 1/2 tsp soya sauce.
1.  Add a tablespoon of olive oil.  This will help prevent foaming.
1.  Secure normal lid and select pressure cook for 20 mins.  Allow pressure to release naturally.
1.  While the beans are cooking, lightly fry the bacon (or beyond meat sausage) in a separate frying pan.
1.  Once the pressure valve has unlocked, add all remaining ingredients.
1.  Cover with glass lid and press slow cook until High temp is selected.
1.  Slow cook for 2 or 3 hours, stirring occasionally.
