- Ingredients:

  - 1 tablespoon yeast
  - 1/2 cup warm water
  - pinch of white sugar
  - 1 cup warm water
  - 2 tablespoons oil
  - 2 teaspoons salt
  - 2 1/3 cups all purpose flour
  - 2/3 cup cake and pastry flour

- Directions:

  - Dissolve yeast in 1/2 cup warm water to which the pinch of sugar has been added. Let sit for 10 minutes.
  - Add the other ingredients to the yeast mixture in order with enough flour to make a soft dough.
  - Let rise for around 1 hour. Punch down.
  - Cut off pieces and roll into saucer shapes - thin and about 5 inches across. Let rest for 20 minutes under plastic wrap - so they do not dry out.
  - Preheat oven and pan to 500 degrees F.
  - Open oven door quickly and place a couple pitas on the pan at a time. Bake for 3 - 5 minutes until they puff up and turn golden.
