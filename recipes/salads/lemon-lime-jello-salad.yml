- Ingredients:

  - 1 small lemon jello
  - 1 small lime jello
  - 2 cups boiling water
  - 2 1/2 cups crushed pineapple
  - 2 cups cottage cheese
  - 1 cup mayonnaise
  - 1 cup whipping cream, whipped
  - 3/4 cup nuts, coarsely chopped (walnuts are good)
  - 1 1/2 teaspoons horseradish
  - 1 cup celery, chopped

- Directions:

  - Dissolve the lemon and lime jellos in the boiling water. Let cool until partially set.
  - Add remaining ingredients in order given.
  - Mix well.
  - Refrigerate.

This was good but don't be afraid to leave things out you think you might not like. I didn't put in the mayonnaise or the horseradish.
